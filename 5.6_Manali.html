                                Naggar Castle is a medieval castle, located in Kullu, Himachal Pradesh, India. Built by Raja Sidh Singh of Kullu in 
                                around 1460 A.D, it was taken over to Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (HPTDC), to run as a heritage 
                                hotel, since 1978. It was the official seat of kings for centuries. According to a legend, Raja Sidh Singh used stones 
                                from the abandoned palace (Gardhak) of Rana Bhonsal to build the castle. He ordered the labourers to form a human chain 
                                over the Beas river connecting its left and right banks to transfer the stones manually. The castle survived the 
                                earthquake of 1905. While most houses in the valley and the nearby city of Jawa were completely ruined, the castle's 
                                use of earthquake-proof techniques helped it sustain despite the calamity.
