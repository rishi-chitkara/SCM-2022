                        Rishikesh, the 'place of the sages' is a celebrated spiritual town located on the banks of the Ganga. Surrounded by Shivaik range of Himalayas on three 
                        sides, it holds a deep cultural and spiritual significance for its visitors. It is believed that when Raibhya Rishi undertook rigorous penance, God 
                        appeared in the form of “Hrishikesh“ and henceforth this area came to be known as Rishikesh. It is the starting point for the Hindu Char Dham pilgrimage, including Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath, to seek spiritual salvation. 
                        Rishikesh is an ideal destination not only for pilgrims but also for those who want to delve deeper into spirituality, yoga and other aspects of ancient 
                        practices. Sacred rivers and mountains make a perfect stage for yoga and reflective hikes. Rishikesh is also called the 'Yoga capital of the world'. For 
                        the adventurous, Rishikesh is the place for starting their trekking expeditions and excursions towards the Himalayan peaks.

                        Rishikesh, the 'place of the sages' is a celebrated spiritual town located on the banks of the Ganga. Surrounded by Shivaik range of Himalayas on three 
                        sides, it holds a deep cultural and spiritual significance for its visitors. It is believed that when Raibhya Rishi undertook rigorous penance, God 
                        appeared in the form of “Hrishikesh“ and henceforth this area came to be known as Rishikesh. It is the starting point for the Hindu Char Dham pilgrimage, including Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath, to seek spiritual salvation. 
                        Rishikesh is an ideal destination not only for pilgrims but also for those who want to delve deeper into spirituality, yoga and other aspects of ancient 
                        practices. Sacred rivers and mountains make a perfect stage for yoga and reflective hikes. Rishikesh is also called the 'Yoga capital of the world'. For 
                        the adventurous, Rishikesh is the place for starting their trekking expeditions and excursions towards the Himalayan peaks.
