                                Poee or poie is a leavened bread baked by the traditional bakers called poders in Goa, where it is a staple food. It 
                                has characteristics similar to a pita bread, notably that it is round, soft, and has a pocket. Coconut palm wine or toddy 
                                was traditionally used for the fermenting process but yeast is now used in commercial production. The bread is made from 
                                half-maida and half-whole wheat flour. Bread is a significant part of Goan cuisine, introduced by the Portuguese in the 
                                early 17th century. Ross poee, a dish of an omelet, xacuti and poee, is a typical item of Goan home cooking. Poee traditionally 
                                was prepared by fermenting it with toddy for two days, rolling it into a ball, flattening it, and baking it on the floor of a 
                                wood-fired oven.

                                Often mistaken for an idli, a sanna is a Goan-Mangalorean festive delicacy made from a fermented mix of 
                                fat-grained parboiled rice, coconut, sugar, salt and that all-important leavening agent, the sap of coconut 
                                palm colloquially known as 'toddy' or sur in Konkani. Toddy is one of the main differences between sanna and 
                                idli. In idli, urad dal (black gram) is used for fermentation. Forsaking an idli steamer for a funnel-topped 
                                chondro steamer, sanna is always spooned into small, steel vatis (bowls), also called gindlaan in Mangaluru, 
                                which give it its round, cake-like shape unlike idli's convex contours. Texturally, a sanna is spongier, with 
                                a glossy white finish unlike the more crumbly idli â€” although often the red Goan parboiled rice renders a few 
                                tiny red flecks onto a sanna's surface.

                                Sorpotel is a red meat curry that is wonderfully tangy and spicy at the same time. It is a dish of Portuguese
                                origin, now cooked in the Konkan region of India - Goa, Mangalore and Maharasthra's East India Community. 
                                Goan Sorpotel is generally made using pork, but sometimes it also includes beef, mutton or chicken. Though 
                                originally intended to be made solely on the occasion of Christmas, it often appears at parties and other 
                                festivities today. It is very popular among Catholic households of Goa, as well as food lovers who have had 
                                this dish at least once.Sorpotel is often made in huge quantities for festivals, weddings and birthday 
                                parties. Thus, the preparation for the curry begins several days in advance. This is a boon in disguise, 
                                as Sorpotel gets better as it grows older.

                                Located in Canacona in Southern Goa, Palolem Beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in Goa. Known for its
                                picturesque natural beauty and uncanny party vibes, this semi-circular beach is only a mile long. Therefore, 
                                you will not require much time to explore all the beautiful sites that the beach has to offer. So, whether 
                                you are thinking about venturing out with a partner, or on your own, Palolem beach will always be enjoyable 
                                to you in every way. The northern side of the beach is known to be a little bit safer, as the tides are 
                                somewhat calmer in this area. Nevertheless, if you have an unearthly thirst for adventure, then you should 
                                pay a visit to the southern part of the beach. In this section, the nature of the tides is more uncertain 
                                and precarious. Therefore, here, you can indulge in numerous types of water activities, such as kayaking and 
                                boat riding.

                                Fort Aguada is a 17th-century Portuguese fort looking out at the confluence of Mandovi River and the Arabian 
                                Sea. The crumbling ramparts of the fort stand on the Sinquerim Beach, approximately 18 km from Panjim. The 
                                highlight of the fort is a lone four-storey lighthouse and a stunning view
                                of the sunset. Built-in 1612 as a protection from Dutch and Marathas, Fort Aguada was the most prized and 
                                crucial fort for the Portuguese and covers the entire peninsula at the southwestern tip of Bardez. The fort 
                                is so named after the Portuguese Word for water i.e. 'Agua' and used to be a replenishing source of freshwater 
                                for sailors. In fact, it has the capacity to hold 2,376,000 gallons of water and was one of the biggest freshwater 
                                reservoirs of Asia. Fort Aguada has also been used as Aguada jail. A statue in front of the jail salutes the 
                                freedom fighters, giving the fort a touch of patriotism.

                                once every decade. A site with rich cultural and religious significance, the Basilica of Bom Jesus has been 
                                declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Literally translating to 'Holy Jesus', this is the only church in 
                                Old Goa that is not been plastered on the outside. Inside, the floor of the Basilica is made of marble mosaic 
                                with precious stones, giving it a solemn appearance. Above all is the 
                                image of the Holy Trinity, which is the most sacred symbol in Christianity. The Basilica of Bom Jesus is over

                                Poee or poie is a leavened bread baked by the traditional bakers called poders in Goa, where it is a staple food. It 
                                has characteristics similar to a pita bread, notably that it is round, soft, and has a pocket. Coconut palm wine or toddy 
                                was traditionally used for the fermenting process but yeast is now used in commercial production. The bread is made from 
                                half-maida and half-whole wheat flour. Bread is a significant part of Goan cuisine, introduced by the Portuguese in the 
                                early 17th century. Ross poee, a dish of an omelet, xacuti and poee, is a typical item of Goan home cooking. Poee traditionally 
                                was prepared by fermenting it with toddy for two days, rolling it into a ball, flattening it, and baking it on the floor of a 
                                wood-fired oven.

                                Often mistaken for an idli, a sanna is a Goan-Mangalorean festive delicacy made from a fermented mix of 
                                fat-grained parboiled rice, coconut, sugar, salt and that all-important leavening agent, the sap of coconut 
                                palm colloquially known as 'toddy' or sur in Konkani. Toddy is one of the main differences between sanna and 
                                idli. In idli, urad dal (black gram) is used for fermentation. Forsaking an idli steamer for a funnel-topped 
                                chondro steamer, sanna is always spooned into small, steel vatis (bowls), also called gindlaan in Mangaluru, 
                                which give it its round, cake-like shape unlike idli's convex contours. Texturally, a sanna is spongier, with 
                                a glossy white finish unlike the more crumbly idli â€” although often the red Goan parboiled rice renders a few 
                                tiny red flecks onto a sanna's surface.

                                Sorpotel is a red meat curry that is wonderfully tangy and spicy at the same time. It is a dish of Portuguese
                                origin, now cooked in the Konkan region of India - Goa, Mangalore and Maharasthra's East India Community. 
                                Goan Sorpotel is generally made using pork, but sometimes it also includes beef, mutton or chicken. Though 
                                originally intended to be made solely on the occasion of Christmas, it often appears at parties and other 
                                festivities today. It is very popular among Catholic households of Goa, as well as food lovers who have had 
                                this dish at least once.Sorpotel is often made in huge quantities for festivals, weddings and birthday 
                                parties. Thus, the preparation for the curry begins several days in advance. This is a boon in disguise, 
                                as Sorpotel gets better as it grows older.

                                Located in Canacona in Southern Goa, Palolem Beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in Goa. Known for its
                                picturesque natural beauty and uncanny party vibes, this semi-circular beach is only a mile long. Therefore, 
                                you will not require much time to explore all the beautiful sites that the beach has to offer. So, whether 
                                you are thinking about venturing out with a partner, or on your own, Palolem beach will always be enjoyable 
                                to you in every way. The northern side of the beach is known to be a little bit safer, as the tides are 
                                somewhat calmer in this area. Nevertheless, if you have an unearthly thirst for adventure, then you should 
                                pay a visit to the southern part of the beach. In this section, the nature of the tides is more uncertain 
                                and precarious. Therefore, here, you can indulge in numerous types of water activities, such as kayaking and 
                                boat riding.

                                Fort Aguada is a 17th-century Portuguese fort looking out at the confluence of Mandovi River and the Arabian 
                                Sea. The crumbling ramparts of the fort stand on the Sinquerim Beach, approximately 18 km from Panjim. The

                                of the sunset. Built-in 1612 as a protection from Dutch and Marathas, Fort Aguada was the most prized and 
                                crucial fort for the Portuguese and covers the entire peninsula at the southwestern tip of Bardez. The fort 
                                is so named after the Portuguese Word for water i.e. 'Agua' and used to be a replenishing source of freshwater 
                                for sailors. In fact, it has the capacity to hold 2,376,000 gallons of water and was one of the biggest freshwater 
                                reservoirs of Asia. Fort Aguada has also been used as Aguada jail. A statue in front of the jail salutes the 
                                freedom fighters, giving the fort a touch of patriotism.

                                with precious stones, giving it a solemn appearance. Above all is the
