## Cloning the Repository
First, navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the repository into using commands like:
        ```cd: to change your working directory.
        ```cd ../ to "go back" a level in your directory tree.```
Next, clone the remote repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:

    ```git clone https://github.com/rishi-chitkara/SCM-2022.git

Now you can see the contents of the remote repository on your machine by moving into the newly cloned directory:

    ```cd SCM-2022/
    ```ls -la
