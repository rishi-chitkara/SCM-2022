## Cloning the Repository
First, navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the repository into using commands like:
        
        cd: to change your working directory.
        cd ../ to "go back" a level in your directory tree.
        
        
Next, clone the remote repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:

    
    git clone https://github.com/rishi-chitkara/SCM-2022.git
    

Now you can see the contents of the remote repository on your machine by moving into the newly cloned directory:

    
    cd SCM-2022/
    ls -la
